# Real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview
This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system monitors the driverâ€™s facial features and alerts them if signs of drowsiness are detected. It leverages computer vision techniques and pre-trained Haar Cascade models to identify facial and eye patterns, ensuring safety by reducing the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving.

## Features
- Real-time video feed analysis using a webcam.
- Detection of eyes and face using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- An alarm system that activates when signs of drowsiness are detected.
- Modular design with customizable model components.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV 4.5 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd driver-drowsiness-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
   ```

3. **Download Haar Cascade XML files** (if not included):
   - `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml`
   - `haarcascade_lefteye_2splits.xml`
   - `haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml`
   
   These are pre-trained models for face and eye detection.

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python drowsiness\ detection.py
   ```

2. **How it works**:
   - The program captures real-time video from the default camera.
   - Facial landmarks and eye states are analyzed to determine if the driver is alert or drowsy.
   - If drowsiness is detected, an alarm sound (`alarm.wav`) is played to alert the driver.

3. **Customizing Parameters**:
   - You can modify thresholds for eye closure duration in the script to suit specific requirements.

## Files in the Repository
- **drowsiness detection.py**: Main script for running the detection system.
- **model.py**: Contains the model logic for drowsiness detection.
- **alarm.wav**: Sound file for the alarm.
- **Haar Cascade XML files**: Pre-trained models for face and eye detection.
  - `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml`
  - `haarcascade_lefteye_2splits.xml`
  - `haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml`

## Notes
- Ensure your system has an operational webcam for real-time video processing.
- The alarm file (`alarm.wav`) can be replaced with any desired sound.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Support for multi-driver detection in shared environments.
- Mobile app or embedded system deployment.
